# Weebs-R-Us E-commerce Web App Recreated with MERN Stack

I decided to recreate my final capstone project while at Devmountain, originally created with JS, React, Express, Axios, and PostgreSQL, with a MERN stack instead.\
Weebs-R-Us is an anime e-commerce web application where users can create an account, login/logout of their account, browse items and add to cart, and purchase items.\
This project is not yet hosted as I'm continuing to learn how to code and use MongoDB and Mongoose.
